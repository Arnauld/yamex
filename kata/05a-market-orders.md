Fifth iteration: Market Order
================================================================================

A market order is an order to buy or sell a contract at the best available price.  Generally,
this type of order will be executed immediately.  However, the price at which a market order
will be executed is not guaranteed.  It is important for traders to remember that the last-traded
price is not necessarily the price at which a market order will be executed.  In fast-moving
markets, the price at which a market order will execute often deviates from the last-traded
price or “real time” quote.

Market Orders can have Fill-or-Kill (FoK) and Immediate or Cancel (IoC) parameters.
The first one means that orders either will be filled completely or cancelled in case of
insufficient liquidity. IoC order by contrast will be filled up to the existing level of
liquidity and the resting part will be cancelled.
