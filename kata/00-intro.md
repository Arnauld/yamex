Welcome to Yamex!

Yamex is the next-gen market exchange engine that will probably drives all EURO, AMER and ASIA trading platform.

A central part of a market exchange engine is the matching engine.
A matching engine is a program that accepts orders from buyers and sellers. The other matching module matches buy and sell orders, creates transactions to record the process, and updates the customers account balances.

The matching (or trade allocation) algorithm is an important part of an exchange trading mechanism, since it is responsible for resolving the buy/sell association in a fast and efficient way.

Exchanges set the institutional rules that govern trading and information flows about that trading. They are closely linked to the clearing facilities through which post-trade activities could be completed. An exchange centralizes the communication of bid and offer prices to all direct market participants, who can respond by selling or buying at one of the quotes or by replying with a different quote.
